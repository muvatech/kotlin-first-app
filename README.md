# Introduction
Google has announced a new programming Language for Android, know as Kotlin. Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the JVM. It can also be compiled to JavaScript source code.

Kotlin is a statically-typed language, developed by JetBrains, with syntax more expressive and concise than that of Java. With features like higher-order functions, lambda expressions, operator overloading, string templates, and more, Kotlin has a lot more to offer than Java. Because Java and Kotlin are highly interoperable, they can be used together in the same project.

Hope this tutorial gave a glimpse of how useful Kotlin is for Android Development. You should consider it for your next project! Remember to leave a comment or a question below and I will get back as soon as possible. Have a nice one guys!

Happy Coding!
